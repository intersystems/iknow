# After the build is complete, execute this script on Linux to deploy the wheels
# if appropriate.

# Wheels are assumed to be in ~/wheels/*/*.whl.
#
# We deploy iknowpy if and only if 3 criteria hold.
#   1. The build is due to a push to the master branch.
#   2. Variables PYPI_TOKEN and TESTPYPI_TOKEN are nonempty. 
#   3. The commit that the current build is testing contains a change to
#      modules/iknowpy/iknowpy/version.py.
#
# If the version specified in version.py is a developmental release version as
# defined in PEP 440, then we deploy to TestPyPI. Otherwise, we deploy to PyPI.
# A developmental release version ends with ".devN", where N is the development
# release number. For example, "0.0.10.dev0" is a development release number,
# while "0.0.10" is not.
#
# Required Environment Variables:
# - GITHUB_EVENT_NAME is the event that triggered the workflow
# - GITHUB_REF is the branch ref that triggered the workflow
# - GITHUB_SHA is the commit hash for current build
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
# - PYPI_TOKEN is an API token to the iknowpy repository on PyPI. If unset,
#   deployment is skipped.
# - TESTPYPI_TOKEN is an API token to the iknowpy repository on TestPyPI. If
#   unset, deployment is skipped.
